# 2048
using C to implement game 2048

Simple game 2048

Well, 2048 was too hard for me, so I changed it to 512. 

You can change goal of the game by simply modify macro GOAL.
Or if you want to have a 5 * 5, or 100 * 100 game table, just change value of N, which is the dimention of game table.

Have fun and enjoy it!
